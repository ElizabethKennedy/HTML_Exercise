      <head> Elizabeth Kennedy 
        <p> Elizabeth enjoys literature, astrology, yoga, and roller skating. 
      She is a Pisces sun sign, Libra moon sign, and Aries rising sign. She   
      extracts highly practical everyday applications from the esoteric arts.      
      Coding intimidates her, but she is determined to succeed at it, anyhow.
      Her level of stubbornness is the stuff legends are made of -- her old 
      high school principal once called her "relentless" -- so she isn't fazed 
      by having "total newbie" status in the Information Technology world.
      Elizabeth has a ten-year old daughter who is her version 2.0 clone 
      and regularly provides her with sassy, exasperated tech support.

        I looked down at the board. "The point isn't to win?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"The <strong>point</strong></p>
        <p><span style="color:blue">Bredan</span></p>
        said grandly, "is to <p><u>play</u> </p>a 
        <p><em>beautiful</em></p> 
        game." 
        <p>He lifted his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into
        a beautific smile. "Why would I want to win anything other than 
        a beautiful game?"</p>
